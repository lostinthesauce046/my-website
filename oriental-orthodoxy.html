            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Oriental Orthodoxy is a branch of Eastern Christianity that includes several autocephalous churches. It is distinct from Eastern Orthodoxy and is characterized by its adherence to the teachings of the early ecumenical councils, particularly the Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD, which they rejected.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The Oriental Orthodox Churches trace their origins to the early Christian communities in the Middle East, North Africa, and the Indian subcontinent. The schism that led to the formation of Oriental Orthodoxy occurred after the Council of Chalcedon, which resulted in the separation of the non-Chalcedonian churches from those that accepted the council's definitions of Christology.</p>

            <h2>Beliefs</h2>
            <p>Oriental Orthodox Christians believe in the one nature of Christ (Miaphysitism), which asserts that in the person of Jesus Christ, divine and human natures are united in one nature without separation, confusion, or alteration. This belief contrasts with the Chalcedonian definition, which states that Christ exists in two natures, divine and human.</p>
