            <p>And I saw you while I was sleeping at night,<br>
            And I forgot what my sorrows were.<br>
            I thought my sleep in your presence was wakefulness,<br>
            Until I woke up to another separation.<br>
            If I knew that dreams could bring us together,<br>
            I would close my eyes for eternity.</p>
